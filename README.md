# archivelib
CL program to save a library into a savf
I am always coming across library's that have been created on the system for testing but have not been removed once the testing is completed. I must confess I am also one of the culprits that contributes to the confusion. As a developer you are not sure if there was a legitmate reason why the library was left on, or if removing it will break something else down the road. You still want to unclutter the VTOC but retain the data in case it is needed at some later date. 
This program creates a library and adds savf's incrementing a counter by 1 and saving the library name in the description with a saved date.
You can also use this program to make savf backups of your regular libraries if needed.
CL command is : archivelib (<library-name>)
